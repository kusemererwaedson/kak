                    <p>1.&nbsp;A Client follows a flexible, quarterly investment schedule rather than a one-time commitment to a fund. A Client participates in investments Rubiz Rolling Fund makes for each quarterly fund the Client invests in.</p>

                <!-- faq answer -->

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>New quarterly funds in this Program are created each quarter to invest in on-thesis deals sourced during the quarter. By subscribing, a Client commits to make the subscribed-for capital contribution to each quarterly fund offered through this Program. Each Client is then able to modify or cancel its subscription before the beginning of any subsequent quarterly fund, after meeting the number of quarterly subscriptions the Client initially commits to.

                    </p>
                    <p>A Client's subscription into a quarterly fund also provides that investable capital remaining at the end of the quarterly fund's deployment period may be automatically rolled over into a subsequent quarterly fund. When this happens, a Client receives a corresponding contribution to the subsequent quarterly fund in addition to whatever amount it subscribes for and contributes directly into the subsequent quarterly fund.</p>

                <!-- faq answer -->
                <div class="faq-body">
                   <p>At this point, the funds offered through the Program will not pay a management fee. Rubiz Rolling Fund may choose to increase the management fee of funds offered through this Program, at which point all existing subscribers will have the opportunity to reconfirm their subscription and such increase.</p>
                   <p>TIG Management Centre (TIGMC) launches and maintains each quarterly fund throughout its lifetime. Generally, TIGMC charges a 1.5% admin fee for the maintenance of each quarterly fund’s 5-year lifetime, subject to a Ugx100,000 minimum. Ugx100,000 is paid up front to TIGMC for the setup of each quarterly fund, and the remaining fee is paid out quarterly over the course of the fund’s lifetime.</p>

                <!-- faq answer -->
                <div class="faq-body">
                   <p>Carried interest payment is calculated across a Client's subscription period. The subscription period is the number of quarters to which a Client subscribes in advance. Depending on the options provided by the fund manager, a Client may have a quarter-by-quarter subscription period or a multi-quarter subscription period.</p>
                   <p>If on a quarter-by-quarter subscription period, the Client must be repaid only the amount they contributed to the quarterly fund experiencing the exit before that Client begins to pay carried interest.</p>
                   <p>Certain Clients may pay more or less carry at the discretion of Rubiz Rolling Fund or the funds' investment adviser.</p>
                   <p>For Rubiz Rolling Fund, a Client will pay 30% total carried interest once they have received back 100% of their contributions made during each subscription term.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                   <p>Subscribing Clients participate only in distributions from the quarterly funds to which they contribute. A Client has no interest in portfolio investments of quarterly funds formed before their subscription was accepted or after it is canceled or rejected.</p>

                   <p>As a quarterly fund exits its investments, Clients in that quarterly fund will receive distributions net of fees and any applicable carry. Funds that have not exited all investments by the end of their lifespan will ordinarily be liquidated, subject to the terms of the applicable fund documents. Clients should be prepared to hold their interest in each quarterly fund for its full term.</p>

                   <p>A Client will only participate in investments made by the quarterly funds they subscribed to.

                   <p>No. A Client's pro rata share of funds under this Program may change from quarter-to-quarter based on changes in its subscription amount and the subscriptions made by other Clients.

                   <p>Subscriptions are funded either through wire or via ACH transfer using information submitted through the TIGPE Investments Platform. Clients must fund their subscriptions by the funding deadline indicated on the Platform. If a Client authorizes payment of its subscription by ACH and the Client's TIGPE Investment Platform account balance doesn't cover the Client's full subscription, the remaining balance will be transferred automatically via ACH from the Client's bank account on the funding deadline date.</p>
                   <p>Clients will generally transfer their subscription amount once per quarter. If the initial close of the Program takes place after a fiscal quarter has already begun, the period between the first and second transfers may be less than a quarter.</p>

                   <p>Typically, Clients may increase, decrease, or cancel their subscription amount at any time prior to the subscription deadline for a quarterly fund. Clients that subscribe with a subscription period of two or more quarters must fulfill their subscription period commitments before decreasing or canceling their subscription. Clients can make updates to their subscription from their portfolio and from the Rolling Fund's fund page.</p>
                   <p>Unless modified, a Client's subscription amount and period will auto-renew such that after a subscription period ends, another subscription period of the same quarterly length and commitment amount begins.</p>

Such rollover amounts are treated as additional capital contribution on top of a Client's existing quarterly subscription amount. Clients are not guaranteed rollover contributions and TIGPE may elect to distribute such amounts directly to Clients at the end of a quarterly fund's investment period. Any rejected amount will be returned to a subscriber's TIGPE investor account.</p>
